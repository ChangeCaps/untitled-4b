# DONT OPEN
The folder named 'DONT OPEN' is named that for a reason. If you're
looking to play the game, stay away. All the game assets are located
in there, and just the file names contain spoilers.

# HOW TO PLAY
Put your terminal in full screen, and type `cargo run --release`. For
the best experience, put on your favorite *hacking music* mix.
